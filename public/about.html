<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Sofia, and I am 23 years old. I recently started my journey into the exciting world of programming, and I am passionate about learning new technologies. Currently, I am studying HTML to build my first web pages. Alongside programming, I have experience with Excel, Notion, and I am fluent in English. Outside of work and learning, I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and exploring creative projects. My goal is to become a skilled programmer and transition into a career in tech. This website is one of my first steps in this journey, and I am excited to share it with you!</p>
